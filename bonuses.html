		<h2>History of Crosswords</h2>
		<p>Crosswords were invented in the United States in the early 20th century. One newspaper estimated that five million labor hours were lost every day to the crossword craze that had swept the country. (Jackson, Roddy Howland, 2022) The craze hasn’t exactly died - the NYT made $33m from crosswords in 2018. Id. But in the 1920s, there were many concerns. Libraries had to remove circulation of their dictionaries because of damage to them from overuse; sales of thesauruses soared in response. The 1920s press, particularly in the UK, was snotty about this puzzle form that didn’t seem to take much brain power and didn’t actually produce anything (Raphel, 2020). (I highly recommend visiting <a href="https://publicdomainreview.org/essay/beastly-clues" target="_blank">this article</a> to see some of the cartoons scoffing crossword fervor). </p>
		<p>While individual cryptic clues were used in crosswords prior to Torquemada, or Edward Powys Matthews as he was otherwise known, he supposedly completed the first completely cryptic crossword in 1924. (Cleaver, 2010). </p>
		<p>Apparently, men were selected for the work at Bletchley Park (to combat the Enigma machine during World War II) by their crossword ability. (Hall, 2010).</p>

		<h2>The (Mooted) Benefits of Crosswords</h2>
		<p>Every now and then there is an article in the news about how a new study shows that doing crosswords can stave off dementia. The truth is a little more complicated than the headlines, but psychologists and neuroscientists often study crossword-doing populations as a way of learning how the brain works and trying to provide ways to combat dementia in aging populations. In one study, scientists found that doing crosswords appears to delay dementia, by about 2.5 years. Crosswording was found to be more important, even if started in later life, than educational courses, and could compensate for lower educational levels. (Howard et al., 2016; Pillai et al., 2011). However, when the crossword puzzlers did get dementia, their decrease in cognitive function was much quicker than the non-crosswording cohort. They did also find a significantly higher level of vocabulary among the crossword doers. (Pillai et al., 2011). </p>
		<p>Crosswords are a popular form of study because doing crosswords apparently reveals quite a lot about how our brain works. (Battersby, 2011). Intuition plays a big role in it - if you think the word is right, it often is, and it is reinforced because you tend to spend more time trying to prove yourself correct. It does, however, block your ability to understand the correct word - not having a guess about a word is better than having the wrong guess in terms of being able to solve the clue.</p>
		<p>Sometimes, some of the hardest clues are the ones where the whole clue is the clue - all the skills that help one to complete other clues (looking for cue words, first and last words of the clue) are actually not helpful in this instance. Apparently, this method of breaking things down renders people worse at being able to see the wood for the trees - an experiment found that giving people cryptic crossword puzzles, as opposed to other forms of puzzle (including literal crosswords and sudoku) made them temporarily worse at recognizing faces. (Battersby, 2011).</p>
