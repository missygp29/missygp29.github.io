    <h2>Book Adaptations</h2>
    <p>If you like the stories of the original plays, there are many books based on Shakespeare's works. Some are direct adaptations; others are responses to him, using his characters and creations to expand on and challenge his thinking. </p>
    <p>Below, you'll find just a few of the myriad books out there. If you don't like the look of these, googling Shakespeare adaptations will get you lists you can work through; <a href="https://www.bookriot.com">Book Riot</a> is a good place to start.</p>
