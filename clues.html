<p>
	A lot of cryptic clues are clever, but some are laugh out loud funny or absolutely ingenius. Of course, one might be inclined to be more charitable toward a clue if one can actually solve it. There are some setters who tend to stand out as providing more of these than others. Of those whose names I know - the Jumbo Cryptic in the Saturday Times does not list its setter - my favourite two are <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/profile/paul">Paul</a> and <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/profile/araucaria">Araucaria</a>. They may feature heavily here, but I will also try to find the Times setters to give credit where possible.
