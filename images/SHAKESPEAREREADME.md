About the project development:

I chose this topic because I had a parent who loved Shakespeare and was able to pass that love on to me. But many teens I speak to get told he's important without receiving the tools to engage with him critically or see him presented in a way that makes sense to them. So, I tried to gather sources in a variety of formats to help open the door to Shakespeare a little more. I also included critical scholarship that allows the reader to view Shakespeare and race and gender, for example, that might be meaningful for readers struggling to find his work meaningful.

This website would not be possible without the teaching of Rachel Daniell. https://racheldaniell.com/  She is a marvel. 

In addition, I made this project for Jen Hubert Swan's INFO-677 Class, Literature & Literacy for Young Adults. This was one of the most life affirming, interesting, and dynamic classes that I have ever taken. I cannot recommend her classes highly enough, if you happen to be able to access them. 

Big love to Professor D, who listens to me talk to and argue with the code while I'm coding, and loves me for it.
