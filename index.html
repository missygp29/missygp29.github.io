	<p>Hello! Welcome to Crosswording. Here, we look at the rather particular world of British Cryptic Crosswords. Niche, admittedly, but doing crosswords expands your vocabulary, oils your brain, and is an excellent way to while away your time.
		<br>From here, you can find out more about me and why I do crosswords, or <a href="index.html#see-more">find your way</a> to more interesting things about crosswords.

	<h2>Why Crosswording?</h2> 
</div>
<div>
	<p>There are many types of delightful crosswords out there but, here, when I talk about crosswords I mean British cryptic crosswords - the kind usually published in newspapers that uses a shared vocabulary and techniques for solving them; there is an established language of cryptic clues, and this site is about how we solve them and why they are my favourite form.
		<br>I grew up doing cryptic crosswords; learning how to do them is something my mother taught me; it's something I want to teach my own children; it is a bond between my stepmother and me; and is one of the pastimes that calms me by engaging my brain and sense of curiosity. 
	</p>
	<p>The crosswords I grew up doing were in the Guardian and the Telegraph (not politically my thing, but the sport coverage was good and it had general knowledge as well as cryptic crosswords). But as an adult, I now mainly do the Guardian, still, and I have fallen in love with the Saturday Times Jumbo Cryptic Crosswords.

		<br>They are fun; soothing; challenging; satisfying. But, mostly, they are a connection with my Mum, a brilliant woman who taught me everything she knew with great generosity and then didn't begrudge in any way when I exceeded what she taught me. I got my first Jumbo Cryptic Crossword compilation when my eldest child was born, and I cherish the tattered copy, with clues solved in her handwriting alongside mine and my spouse's.
