        <div class="introduction">
          <p>I donâ€™t really remember when I started to learn how to parse cryptic crossword clues; the only thing I do really remember are the places where clues started to make sense. </p>
          <p>There are two places fundamental to my ability to do crosswords: first and foremost, the living room sofa at home, where my Mum and I would sit with tea and try to complete the Telegraph or Guardian crosswords together. Second, the bar at my college where, after early morning lectures, I would congregate with a group of non-science students who were just getting up, and we would have tea or coffee and try to do the Guardian crossword together. There were particular setters who caused a frisson of discomfort when their names were spotted, as we knew we were in for a tough time without the ease of anagrams (Bunthorne, in particular, was my nemesis). </p>
          <p>These places and people taught me how to pull apart clues, to understand the cues and signals embedded within them, and how to translate them into other words. A little bit like trying to create this website.</p>

          <p>There is no getting around that a lot of this requires British cultural knowledge; not just any old cultural knowledge, but a particular streak of the British fee-paying school (followed, of course, by Oxbridge) realm of knowledge embedded within it - terms for serving within the armed forces, cricket, opera, Shakespeare quotes, that sort of thing. Therefore, the below may not help a lot, but hopefully it will move the needle in the right direction.</p>
