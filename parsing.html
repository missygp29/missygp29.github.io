        <div class="introduction">
          <p>I learnt to parse in two main places - the sofa in our front room at home, with my Mum and a cup of tea; and then, later, at college, in the common room with friends. You can definitely do this yourself, but it is easier with people who know what they're doing. There is no getting around that a lot of this requires British cultural knowledge; not just any old cultural knowledge, but the very particular realm of the British fee-paying school (followed, of course, by Oxbridge) - terms for serving within the armed forces, cricket, opera, Shakespeare quotes, that sort of thing. Therefore, the below - steps to parsing, typical cue words, and a cue glossary - may not help a lot, but is a start.</p>

          <h2>How to Parse a Crossword (sort of)</h2>
          <ol class="parsing">
            <li class="parsing-steps">
              <em>Read the whole thing through.</em> The answer or method to solve it might jump out at you immediately! If not... keep going.
            </li>
            <li class="parsing-steps">
              <em>Words/Letters.</em> There are parentheses at the end of each clue that contain at least one number. That tells you how many letters are in the word; if there is more than one number, separated by a comma, then it tells you the letters in each word in the order the numbers appear. So, (9,4) means two words; the first has 9 letters, the second has 4. If the word is hyphenated, that will be in the parentheses e.g. (4-3,2) is a hyphenated word with 4 then 3 letters, then a 2 letter word.
              <br>In some ways, the longer clues are easier if they are multiple words, because they are going to be a phrase or the title of a book, play, or something like that.
              <br>E.g., Ingredients: one large ship, one large iceberg (1,6,3,8). 18 letters, but broken up into easier words. (Answer: a recipe for disaster)
            </li>
            <li class="parsing-steps">
              <em>Check the first and last words.</em> Usually, the meaning of the clue is positioned at the beginning or the end of the sentence. It might, however, be one of those pesky clues where the entire phrase implies the answer, but those are nowhere near as common - only worry about that if you can't parse it otherwise. Those types of the clues are usually the ones I struggle with the most, and I think that's not uncommon - <a href="bonuses.html">research implies</a> that cryptic crosswording requires a brain to break everything down rather than seeing the whole.
              <br>E.g., Piper's beginning with Highlander's short lament (4). The meaning will most likely be "piper's" or "lament." In this case, it was lament; the answer is weep.
            </li>
            <li class="parsing-steps"><em>Check for cue words.</em> Frequently, there are cue words that tell you to do something to another part of the clue. This might be an anagram; it might be to use initial letters of a word or words; it might tell you to use an established set of letters. Wherever I have listed a cue word, generally, synonyms will do the same thing (e.g. destroying could be a synonym for breaking and so indicate an anagram).
