        </div>
        <div class="introduction">
          <p>I donâ€™t really remember when I started to learn how to parse cryptic crossword clues; the only thing I do really remember are the places where clues started to make sense. </p>
          <p>There are two places fundamental to my ability to do crosswords: first and foremost, the living room sofa at home, where my Mum and I would sit with tea and try to complete the Telegraph or Guardian crosswords together. Second, the bar at my college where, after early morning lectures, I would congregate with a group of non-science students who were just getting up, and we would have tea or coffee and try to do the Guardian crossword together. There were particular setters who caused a frisson of discomfort when their names were spotted, as we knew we were in for a tough time without the ease of anagrams (Bunthorne, in particular, was my nemesis). </p>
          <p>These places and people taught me how to pull apart clues, to understand the cues and signals embedded within them, and how to translate them into other words. A little bit like trying to create this website.</p>
        </div>
        <div>
          <p>There is no getting around that a lot of this requires British cultural knowledge; not just any old cultural knowledge, but a particular streak of the British fee-paying school (followed, of course, by Oxbridge) realm of knowledge embedded within it - terms for serving within the armed forces, cricket, opera, Shakespeare quotes, that sort of thing. Therefore, the below may not help a lot, but hopefully it will move the needle in the right direction.</p>

          <h3>How to Parse a Crossword (sort of)</h3>
          <ol class="parsing">
            <li class="parsing-steps">
              <em>Read the whole thing through.</em> The answer or method to solve it might jump out at you immediately! If not... keep going.
            </li>
            <li class="parsing-steps">
              <em>Words/Letters.</em> There are parentheses at the end of each clue that contain at least one number. That tells you how many letters are in the word; if there is more than one number, separated by a comma, then it tells you the letters in each word in the order the numbers appear. So, (9,4) means two words; the first has 9 letters, the second has 4. If the word is hyphenated, that will be in the parentheses e.g. (4-3,2) is a hyphenated word with 4 then 3 letters, then a 2 letter word.
              <br>In some ways, the longer clues are easier if they are multiple words, because they are going to be a phrase or the title of a book, play, or something like that.
              <br>E.g., Ingredients: one large ship, one large iceberg (1,6,3,8). 18 letters, but broken up into easier words. (Answer: a recipe for disaster)
            </li>
            <li class="parsing-steps">
              <em>Check the first and last words.</em> Usually, the meaning of the clue is positioned at the beginning or the end of the sentence. It might, however, be one of those pesky clues where the entire phrase implies the answer, but those are nowhere near as common - only worry about that if you can't parse it otherwise.
              <br>E.g., Piper's beginning with Highlander's short lament (4). The meaning will most likely be "piper's" or "lament." In this case, it was lament; the answer is weep.
            </li>
            <li class="parsing-steps"><em>Check for cue words.</em> Frequently, there are cue words that tell you to do something to another part of the clue. This might be an anagram; it might be to use initial letters of a word or words; it might tell you to use an established set of letters.
            </li>
          </ol>
