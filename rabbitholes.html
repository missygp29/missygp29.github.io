			<p>One of the things I most appreciate about crosswords is that they lead me to phrases, words, or concepts that I simply did not know or understand before. Because you, as the solver, parse the clues, that parsing leads you to unknown words that, when you look them up, add to your knowledge bank. They can also lead you down the rabbit hole into those fields that you don’t know much about - botany and ornithology in particular for me. This page features some of my recent favo(u)rites.</p>

				<p>Asphodel. A pretty, elegant flowering herbaceous perenniel, it was believed to be the flower of the Elysian Fields. It's mentioned in many, many poems including those by Tennyson, Pound, Longfellow, and Milton. The crossword clue led me to this by William Carlos Williams: Asphodel, That Greeny Flower:
    			<br>Of asphodel, that greeny flower,
                <br>like a buttercup
                <br> upon its branching stem-
   				<br> save that it's green and wooden-
                <br>I come, my sweet,
                <br>to sing to you.
   				<br>We lived long together
                <br>a life filled,
            	<br>if you will,
   				<br>with flowers.  So that
            	<br>I was cheered
                <br>when I came first to know
    			<br>that there were flowers also
                <br>in hell.

<br>This is a lauded love poem to a wife; it turns out to be from a man facing his mortality, causing him to profess his love and confess his adultery. Not necessarily my romantic cup of tea, but it's a moving and pretty poem for a very pretty flower.

				<h3>Rodomontade</h3>
<p class="pronounce">Rŏd″ə-mŏn-tād</p>
<p>This is a delight; it is a noun or a verb that means (to) talk boastfully. It comes from the name of a character in an epic - Rodomonte was a boastful king in <em>Orlando Innamorato</em>, a Count Matteo M. Boiardo's late 15th century work; he later appeared in a 16th century sequel, <em>Orlando Furioso</em>, written by another poet. 
<br>Toward the end of the century, English speakers started using an Anglicized version, "rodomont," to refer to a boastful person, a "braggart." From there, it became a noun meaning "empty bluster" or "bragging speech," and later as an adjective meaning "boastful" or "ranting." It also morphed into being a verb meaning to talk boastfully or rant.
<br>It is still used; it came up a couple of times in the <a href="https://hansard.parliament.uk/Lords/2018-06-18/debates/38C39823-F992-450D-AD1F-1A7A0FC6E706/EuropeanUnion(Withdrawal)Bill?highlight=rodomontade#contribution-4ECC3E1A-D876-471D-B83B-71EFE398B531">Brexit debate in the House of Lords.</a> There are so many Shakespearean quotes and turns of phrase that we don't even realize come from his works, and it's always fascinating to see how popular culture or art influences our language today, as seen in <a href="https://www.npr.org/2019/10/07/767903704/the-2010s-social-media-and-the-birth-of-stan-culture">"stan culture."</a></p>

				<h3>Proclitic</h3>
				<p class="pronounce">prəʊˈklɪtɪk</p>
				<p>This is a word I have  never come across and refers to something that I have accepted and taken for granted in English but, now I have noticed it, I am intrigued by it and delighted we have a special word for it.
					<br>According to the <a href="https://www.collinsdictionary.com/dictionary/english/proclitic">Collins Dictionary</a>, it is an adjective that indicates a monosyllabic word or form having no stress or accent and pronounced as a prefix of the following word. It's common in French and Italian; in English, examples are the 't in 'twas or the y' in y'all; it can also be a noun meaning a proclitic word.
					<br>It dates from the 19th century and comes from New Latin proclīticus, from Greek proklinein to lean forwards; formed on the model of enclitic (which is where you have a monosyllabic word or form that is treated as a suffix of the preceding word, as Latin -que in populusque)
					<br>These two words can take you down a huge rabbithole of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clitic">clitics, morphemes, affixes,</a> and things in grammar and linguistics that I cannot do justice to here.

				<p>Ikebana has come up twice in the last five jumbo crosswords I have done, and so it seemed timely to include it here. Ikebana is a traditional Japanese art of flower-arranging. It is a synthesizing of nature and beauty, and there are different styles that aim to reflect different aspects of nature.
				<br>The person best known for <a href="https://bookshop.org/p/books/ikebana-the-art-of-arranging-flowers-shozo-sato/457705?ean=9784805312667">disseminating and teaching ikebana</a> in the US and Europe is also famous for his work on kabuki theater and other Japanese traditional arts. <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sh%C5%8Dz%C5%8D_Sat%C5%8D">Shozo Sato</a> has opened a Japanese Center of Art in California, taught in Illinois, and officiated the wedding of Megan Mullally and Nick Offerman; he knew Nick through <a href="https://www.nickiswift.com/1201536/a-look-at-nick-offerman-and-megan-mullallys-decades-long-romance/">teaching him kabuki at the University of Illinois</a>.</p>
