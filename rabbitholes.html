			<p>One of the things I most appreciate about crosswords is that they lead me to phrases or words that I simply did not know or understand before. Because you, as the solver, parse the clues, that parsing leads you to unknown words that, when you look them up, add to your knowledge bank. They can also lead you down the rabbit hole into those fields that you don’t know much about - botany and ornithology in particular for me. This page features some of my recent favo(u)rites.</p>

					Asphodel. A pretty, elegant flowering herbaceous perenniel, it was believed to be the flower of the Elysian Fields. It's mentioned in many, many poems including those by Tennyson, Pound, Longfellow, and Milton. The crossword clue led me to this by William Carlos Williams: Asphodel, That Greeny Flower:
    <br>Of asphodel, that greeny flower,
                            <br>like a buttercup
                                                   <br> upon its branching stem-
   <br> save that it's green and wooden-
                           <br>I come, my sweet,
                                                    <br>to sing to you.
    <br>We lived long together
                            <br>a life filled,
                                                    <br>if you will,
    <br>with flowers.  So that
                           <br>I was cheered
                                                  <br>when I came first to know
    <br>that there were flowers also
                           <br>in hell.

<br>This is a lauded love poem to a wife; it turns out to be from a man facing his mortality, causing him to profess his love and confess his adultery. Not necessarily my romantic cup of tea, but it's a moving and pretty poem for a very pretty flower.

				<h3>Rodomontade</h3>
<p class="pronounce">Rŏd″ə-mŏn-tād</p>
<p>This is a delight; it is a noun or a verb that means (to) talk boastfully. It comes from the name of a character in an epic - Rodomonte was a boastful king in <em>Orlando Innamorato</em>, a Count Matteo M. Boiardo's late 15th century work; he later appeared in a 16th century sequel, <em>Orlando Furioso</em>, written by another poet. 
<br>Toward the end of the century, English speakers started using an Anglicized version, "rodomont," to refer to a boastful person, a "braggart." From there, it became a noun meaning "empty bluster" or "bragging speech," and later as an adjective meaning "boastful" or "ranting." It also morphed into being a verb meaning to talk boastfully or rant.
<br>It is still used; it came up a couple of times in the <a href="https://hansard.parliament.uk/Lords/2018-06-18/debates/38C39823-F992-450D-AD1F-1A7A0FC6E706/EuropeanUnion(Withdrawal)Bill?highlight=rodomontade#contribution-4ECC3E1A-D876-471D-B83B-71EFE398B531">Brexit debate in the House of Lords.</a> There are so many Shakespearean quotes and turns of phrase that we don't even realize come from his works, and it's always fascinating to see how popular culture or art influences our language, even today, as with the term <a href="https://www.npr.org/2019/10/07/767903704/the-2010s-social-media-and-the-birth-of-stan-culture">"stan culture."</a></p>
