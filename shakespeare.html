  <div><h2>Why Shakespeare?</h2>
  <p>Reading and knowing more about Shakespeare taps into a couple of things that are important for young adults.</p>
  <p>First, a commitment to learning, particularly reading for pleasure.</p> 
  <p>Second, if you find a love for Shakespeare, it can open a doorway to creative activities, such as working in the theater or poetry.</p>
</div>
  <div><h2>How to Read Shakespeare</h2></div>

<div id="howtoread">
<div>
<p>Most of us come across Shakespeare for the first time in a setting in a classroom with it as assigned reading (an excerpt, not even the whole thing). It's a miracle any of us grow to love his work. These plays were made to be <em>performed</em>.</p>
<p>Shakespeare isn't easy for our modern ears. And there is a <a href="../criticism.html">lot that's problematic</a>, but so much to enjoy. Here are some tricks and tips to understand Shakespeare's words.</p></div>

  <h2>What to Read</h2>
  <p>So, you're going to read some Shakespeare. There are so many versions! People swear by the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arden_Shakespeare">Arden versions</a>, but they can be intimidating (so. many. notes.). If you can get Pelican versions, go for it! (You should be able to get some from your library or secondhand online at places like <a href="https://www.thriftbooks.com">Thrift Books</a> or <a href="https://www.abebooks.com">Abe Books</a>, for example); <a href="https://www.folger.edu/explore/shakespeares-works/?_ga=2.157921338.1611153668.1713742942-1697388527.1713742941">Folger has free versions!</a> But which plays? And how? Here are a few ways you could approach it:
    <ul>
<li>Select plays for which you can find good filmed versions - whether films of theater performances, movies that adhere faithfully to the original play, or updates. Watch it first and try to find the rhythm and feel, with the printed version to read along and make notes, if that helps.</li>
<li>Read aloud a play with friends! It might feel weird to ask them to do it, but a read aloud is likely to get the feel of it. And you can assist each other in understanding.</li>
<li>Find a buddy to read all the plays! You can get a collected works and read them all individually and compare. <a href="https://www.thestorygraph.com">The Storygraph</a> has a great readalong with friends feature. You could go by reading them in the order in your book, if you have the collected works. My (Pelican) copy has them alphabetically within genre, and I wanted to mix it up a bit and see the progression as Shakespeare aged and grew. So, I'm using the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chronology_of_Shakespeare%27s_plays">Wikipedia version</a> and I'll stick to that as I reread them.</p></li>  
<li>And for a really big challenge, some people read them all in a year! It takes about 15-20 minutes of reading per day, allegedly. If that seems intriguing, check out <a href="https://www.folger.edu/blogs/shakespeare-and-beyond/shakespeare-2020-project-reading-plan-complete-works-one-year/">this Folger article about it</a> and <a href="https://iandoescher.com/shakespeare/schedule/">the schedule</a>.
</li>  
<li>Lastly, you could bypass the plays altogether and read the poems!</li>
</ul>
