  <div><h2>Why Shakespeare?</h2>
  <p>Reading and knowing more about Shakespeare taps into a couple of things that are important for young adults.</p>
  <p>First, a commitment to learning, particularly reading for pleasure.</p> 
  <p>Second, if you find a love for Shakespeare, it can open a doorway to creative activities, such as working in the theater.</p>
  <p>So, read on.</p>
</div>
  <div><h2>How to Read Shakespeare</h2></div>

<div id="howtoread">
<div>
<p>Most of us come across Shakespeare for the first time in a setting not conducive to creating love for Shakespeare - in a classroom, assigned reading (very possibly an excerpt, rather than the whole thing), instead of in a performance that shows us the rhythm, the flow, the mood, the context. These plays were made to be performed, not published and read in what can be a very sterile environment.</p>
<p>Shakespeare isn't easy for our modern ears. If you have not been taught how to read him, it's no fun. It's arduous to look up every other word.</p> 
<p>But, if you can get into the rhythm and flow of his work, it can be marvelous. There's lots that's problematic (<a href="#criticism">see more below!</a>), but so much to unravel and luxuriate in. So, here are some tricks and tips to help us learn how to understand Shakespeare's words.</p></div>

  <p>There are a million and one Shakespeare adaptations - those that are more closely based on the plays, and those that put a different spin on things (and take liberties such as making something like <italic>Taming of the Shrew</italic> less utterly misogynistic.)</p>
