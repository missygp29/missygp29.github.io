  <div><h2>Why Shakespeare?</h2>
  <p>Reading and knowing more about Shakespeare taps into a couple of things that are important for young adults.</p>
  <p>First, a commitment to learning, particularly reading for pleasure.</p> 
  <p>Second, if you find a love for Shakespeare, it can open a doorway to creative activities, such as working in the theater.</p>
  <p>So, read on.</p>

  <div><h2>How to Read Shakespeare</h2></div>

<div id="howtoread">
<div>
<p>Most of us come across Shakespeare for the first time in a setting not conducive to creating love for Shakespeare - in a classroom, assigned reading (very possibly an excerpt, rather than the whole thing), instead of in a performance that shows us the rhythm, the flow, the mood, the context. These plays were made to be performed, not published and read in what can be a very sterile environment.</p>
<p>Shakespeare isn't easy for our modern ears. If you have not been taught how to read him, it's no fun. It's arduous to look up every other word.</p> 
<p>But, if you can get into the rhythm and flow of his work, it can be marvelous. There's lots that's problematic (<a href="#criticism">see more below!</a>), but so much to unravel and luxuriate in. So, here are some tricks and tips to help us learn how to understand Shakespeare's words.</p></div>

  <h2>Movie Adaptations</h2></div>
  <!-- here, want to put in some flex items that can be a few together?-->
  <p>There are a million and one Shakespeare adaptations - those that are more closely based on the plays, and those that put a different spin on things (and take liberties such as making something like <italic>Taming of the Shrew</italic> less utterly misogynistic and harsh.)</p>

<div><a href ="https://thestackspodcast.com">The Stacks</a> is a podcast whose host, Traci Thomas, came to Shakespeare through being a theater major and dancer. She's also a great critical thinker and explores race and gender throughout any work she reads. This interview with prominent scholar Farah Karim-Cooper is fascinating about how the Shakespearean and academic community responds to discussions of race.</div>

  <h2>Shakespearean Insults</h2>
  <p>Want to take your insulting to another level? Stand out from the crowd? Shakespeare is famous for his insults! No matter what you're trying to say, it's likely that Shakespeare has an insult for you.</p>
<p>You can, of course, discover these by reading the plays. But, if that's not working for you right now, you can always use one of the Internet's already made insult lists.</p> 
<p>Alternatively, some ingenious people have put together random Shakespeare insult generators, putting together various insulting words found in Shakespeare, then into new combinations.</p>
